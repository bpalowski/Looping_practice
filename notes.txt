How can loops contribute toward DRY code? Why is DRY code important?
-Loops allow us to reduce the lines written by automating things such as
string concatination or array mutation. Dry code is important because
it forces us to make our code easier to change or modify later on.

If we used forEach() to loop through an array called 'kittens', what should 
we call the parameter in the forEach() function? Why?
- We would call the parameter by a singular identifier rather than plural
(kitten) as we are only referencing a single index of the array. We do this
to make our code easier to understand.

What does the += operator do?
-The += operator adds the variable to whatever variable you are adding it to.
(i = i + b;/ i += b;)
